How to succesfully run the program (do only this actions):
1. Change server IP on yours in server/server_side.py
2. Write this IP also to all clients: client1/client_side1.py, client2/client_side2.py, client3/client_side3.py
3. Check if ports 50001, 50002, 50003 on server are free. If not, using terminal kill processes in ports (in Unix sudo kill -9 PID).
4. run server/server_side.py
5. run all or some of clients: client1/client_side1.py, client2/client_side2.py, client3/client_side3.py
6. Follow the instructions in clients' terminal. 
	-  Decision 1 means uploading existing file. You should have a txt file in clients directory and write its name when you are asked to. 
	-  Decision 2 means creating new file. Simply write a unique file name in format 'name.txt'
	-  Decision 3 means working on exisiting file. You should write a filename from a list of existing file as well as to know password to the file. By default you can work on file 'file1.txt', the password for this file is '123'.
